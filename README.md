## Project status

I wrote Igniter almost 2 years ago because I needed something to solve a direct problem I was having on the project I was working on. Back then I didn't know if I was going to continue working on this as side project. 
However then I changed job and country so I put a bit aside this project.

During the last few months I ended up in thinking about what to do with this and eventually I decided not to abandon it and I will be going to rewrite igniter with a few new concepts in mind. 

The main idea about the new design is that igniter should be a good and extensible process manager for the developer's environment. Today's applications tent sometimes to depend on different other processes during the dev lifecycle that might not be needed in production.

The future igniter will have a few key features that I want to concentrate on which are:
* workspace (Possibility to define and manage more processes)
	*  process dependency (ie: start app after the database)
	* log aggregation
* lifecycle hooks
	* run a command before and after staring/stopping the process
	* run a command before and after starting/stopping the workspace
* retry on fail
* log collection 
* config file to indicate
	* process to start
	* working directory
	* env variables
	* name
	* retry policy
	* process dependencies
	* `before_start` command
	* `after_start` command

I will be starting to work on this in the near future ðŸ˜„ 




**UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**

## Description
Igniter was written for fun and profit, the idea behind it is to a simple process manager to be used while developing projects that need some always on dependencies.  
So imagine to be developing a frontend application and you need the API active on your machine and maybe some other dependencies (a database for example), Igniter reads an `.igniterc` file and starts all the processes described into the configuration file.

There are a lot of other process manangers into the wild and most of them use a daemon process which monitors and manages all the child processes. Igniter does not provide a global daemon but instead runs a monitor process for every launched one, so there is a one-to-one relationship bewteen the process to be launched and the one which monitors.

Igniter is in its early stages, under active development and for such reasons is not _yet_ feature complete neither its code is near to be considered good or safe. A list of future development ideas can be found into a further paragraph.  
Suggestion and/or requests are always welcome!

### Supported operating systems
Given its dependencies the supported OSs are the ones which are supported by `nix` (look [here](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix#supported-platforms)), this does not directly means that all the version are tested.

Currently there is no **Windows** support.

## Install
With cargo: 

```bash
cargo install igniter
```
## Usage

With an existing `.igniterc` file into the current working directory issue `igniter` from your terminal and Igniter will spawn all the processes defined into the configuration file.

### .igniterc
Create an `.igniterc`, `TOML` syntax supported, file in the root of your project. It is always needed a `.igniterc` file to start monitoring a process.
```toml
[[process]]
name = "process-1" # Required, the name of the process. Shown in list.
cmd = "process" # The actual command to launch, must be the command without arguments
args = [["-arg", "value"], ["--arg2"]]  # Optional, must be an array of array
max_retries = 10 # Optional, defaults to 0
```


The above block can be repeated any time needed into the same file to describe other processes, just mind to change the name.
